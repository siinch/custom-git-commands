# custom-git-commands
To add the commands on windows open the terminal and write:

git config --global alias.new "!C:/Scripts/new-command.bat"

Make sure to replace "new" with the name you wish to use for your command. Also remember to supply the correct path to the file with the command.

It should also work with .cmd files, but this has not been tested yet.
